# Sorting algorithms & Big O

At this project, we are going to explain:

* At least four different sorting algorithms
*   What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
*  How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
*   What is a stable sorting algorithm.

This is a peer project done by:
